<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
<p>There are multiple different watchlist sites that appear around the internet. You can always share the link to 
your watchlist to others. However, none of them have the ability to add friends on the site itself. This app will 
connect with an up-to-date movie/TV show api and allow others to connect to each other</p>

<h1>User Stories</h1>
<ol>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able to link with my friends to see what movies and shows they're watching, so I can talk to them about their favorite parts of what they're watching.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to see the newest movies and TV shows, so I can stay up to date with the latest media trends.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to see ratings and recommendations from my friends, so I can choose what to watch next.</li>
    <li>As a director, I want to see what people are recommending and rating, so I can find the trending genre to make for new content.</li>
    <li>As a developer, I want to be able to use a simple API, so I can add new features easily and efficiently.</li>
</ol>
