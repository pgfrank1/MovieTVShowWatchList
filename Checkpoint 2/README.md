# Checkpoint 2
I have included my database design in PDF form. I haven't updated the design from the Week 7 exercise
as I was planning on storing all the user data within my own database. Now I'll need to read some 
documentation from AWS Cognito to see what information they can store for me, and how to retrieve
that data for use. I believe I will still need the UserFriends table so other's ratings and comments will
appear.
