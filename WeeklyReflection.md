<h3>Week 3 2/6/2023</h3>
<p>I was able to complete my project screen design and I have a decent understanding of how I want the application to flow.
I want to add the ability to add comments to each movie and TV show, but I am a little worried about the time required
to make all that work. I would add those comments to the details page for the specified movie or TV show. If I find that I 
do have time, I'll update the design and have you take a look.</p>
<p>I've also been reading through the API documentation to make sure that I have enough knowledge about it before I start
coding. Fortunately, it seems to be a fairly simple API to use.</p>
<p>For my professional development choice, I've been looking through the documentation and issues but I can't seem
to find a good start for some of these issues that have been appearing. A lot of the good-for-first-contribution tags
are still open issues. I've been monitoring the issues to find one that is a good starting point.</p>

<h3>Week 7</h3>
<p>I was able to successfully use the API to get the poster images for each movie and TV show. It
can also get detailed information about each individual piece of content. I was able to get the
list to show in rows of 2 using JSTL tags. It took a good while but I was able to get it working.
